# Secure Web Application & Threat Hardening

## Internship Program
This project was created as part of the Cryptonic Area Internship Program

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a secure web application with a strong focus on threat
hardening and defensive security. It demonstrates how real-world applications can be protected
against common attacks by implementing secure authentication and authorization flows, strong
password hashing policies, input validation and sanitization, and secure session handling.

## Core Security Scope
- Authentication & Authorization Flow
- Hashing & Password Policies
- Input Validation & Sanitization
- Session Handling & Access Control

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Authentication: Flask-Login (planned)
- Password Hashing: Werkzeug
- Database: SQLite (planned)
